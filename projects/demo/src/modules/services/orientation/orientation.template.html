            <b>Landscape-primary</b>
            is an orientation where the screen width is greater than the screen height. If the device's natural
            orientation is landscape, then it is in landscape-primary when held in that position. If the device's
            natural orientation is portrait, the user agent sets landscape-primary from the two options as shown in the
            screen orientation values table.

        <p>
            <b>Landscape-secondary</b>

            orientation is landscape, it is in landscape-secondary when rotated 180ยบ from its natural orientation. If
            the device's natural orientation is portrait, the user agent sets landscape-secondary from the two options
            as shown in the screen orientation values table.

            orientation values table.
